    "## Kid in a Candy Store\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will create the code that a candy store will use in their state-of-the-art candy vending machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a loop that prints all of the candies in the store to the terminal, with their index stored in brackets beside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example: `\"[0] Snickers\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a second loop that runs for a set number of times determined by the variable `allowance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example: If allowance is equal to five, the loop should run five times.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each time this second loop runs, take in a user's input, preferably a number, and then add the candy with the matching index to the variable `candy_cart`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example: If the user enters \"0\" as their input, \"Snickers\" should be added into the `candy_cart` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use another loop to print all of the candies selected to the terminal."
